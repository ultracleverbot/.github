## Hi there 👋

We are a team dedicated to developing Discord Bots (this is our startup) with the goal of creating good, free, and suitable products for everyone!

The team focuses on creating bots that are stable, scalable, and easy to use, meeting the needs of both small servers and large communities.

## Capabilities & Direction

- Developing Discord Bots using popular languages ​​and frameworks (e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Discord.js, Pycord, etc.)

- Slash commands and context menus

- Server management: moderation, logging, anti-spam

- Utility features: music, economy, leveling, tickets, webhooks

- Integrating databases and third-party services

- Optimizing performance, security, and scalability

We aim to build clean, readable, well-documented source code and are open to contributions from the open-source community.


## Objectives

- To provide high-quality, stable, and reliable Discord Bots

- To share knowledge and experience in bot development through open-source code

- To continuously improve the product based on user feedback
